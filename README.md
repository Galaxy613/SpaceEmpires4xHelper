# Space Empires 4X Helper
![App usage](/usage.gif)

This is a helper app for Space Empires 4X, a board game by GMT Games which you can get here: [Space Empires 4X](https://www.gmtgames.com/p-762-space-empires-4th-printing.aspx)

A much more comprehensive app is [available here](https://space-empires-4x-app.herokuapp.com/) which supports advanced units/technology and even the expansions! That is not within scope of this app, or at least, my initial implementation.

## Who is this app for.

This is for casual games with players that agree to use optional rule 15.1, and not to use advanced technology or units (Fighters, Raiders, etc.)

## Using the app.

This app was made with [Godot 3.1](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/3.1.1/Godot_v3.1.1-stable_win64.exe.zip) ([Download page](https://godotengine.org/download)) I want to eventually release it on Android and iPhone if I can find someone with an active Apple Developer account.

You can try it out with a browser that supports WebAssembly [here](http://karlnyborg.com/se4x/SpaceEmpires.html).

## About / License

I made this just as a fun project to be useful for playing SE4X, and as a way to ease myself in to working with Godot.

I chose GPL v3 because I want this to be freely available for the community but I don't want this code being reused or sold elsewhere. Mainly because this code is baaad and should probably be just an example of how NOT to do it - but it works so it must be profitable to someone.
